### Interest in different fields of coding
- **Competitive Programming**:- I started solving problems on CodeChef but recently I have developed more interest in ML and AI compared to CP. 
- **Machine Learning**:- I find Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence interesting. I have completed Andrew Ng's ML course till week 5 and also following IITG.ai's summer course.
